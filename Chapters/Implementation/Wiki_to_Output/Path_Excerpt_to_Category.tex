\subsection{Mapping based on Wikipedia Path Excerpts}
\label{sec:mapping_based_on_wikipedia_path_excerpts}
The other attempt was built on the idea that a the mapping from Wikipedia category and output categories needs more information about the Wikipedia categories. The idea is that this information could be found in excerpts of articles' full paths. Thus, the mapping process is based on excerpts of the paths, which should be mapped to one or more output categories. This approach solves the problem with ambiguous category names, because we specify the meaning of the category name in the path excerpt (see figure \ref{fig:solving_disambiguation})

\subsection{Automatic Mapping}
We started out by manually creating mappings between path excerpts and IAB categories, but this is a large task sins there exists so many categories and category links in Wikipedia's structure. Thus, it is desirable to automate the mapping process between.

We tried to find a good way to predict matches between the excerpts and the output categories. We assumed that the IAB subcategory name (e.e., \emph{Auto parts}) is a category, and wanted to find the most likely categories leading to this category. This was done by finding all categories leading to this category among the top 3 category paths for each Wikipedia title, and counting the occurrences. All patch excerpts among the 10 most common were chosen if they seemed logical.

To see if the automated categorization process were successful, these results had to be compared to a manual categorization. We tested our

Our mapping process between path excerpts of Wikipedia categories and IAB categories has to be controlled by humans. It is desirable to make this task as automatic as possible. 

The mapping process is not completely automated since the mapping between path excerpts of Wikipedia categories and IAB categories has to be evaluated by humans.
