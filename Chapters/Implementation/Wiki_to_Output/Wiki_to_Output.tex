\section{Mapping to Desirable Output Categories}
Our goal for the mapping process is to create a link between Wikipedia article titles and one or more categories from the desirable output categories. It is essential to know the meaning of the WIkipedia articles in order to create such a mapping. Our theory is that this information can be found in the full paths of the articles, where a 
%, the next step is to create a link between all Wikipedia categories and the desirable categories. 
full path of a Wikipedia article contains the categories visited to reach the article. This means that the  machine needs some predefined knowledge to identify the meaning of the paths. Two approaches were tried for this task; creating a mapping between Wikipedia categories and output categories, and creating mapping between path excerpts and output categories. 

%the first was to create a mapping between the Wikipedia categories and a category from the set of output categories and the second approach was to 
%knowing the meaning of the categories is important to understand the meaning of the article.

% Important: det er viktig at noe mapper til alle Ã¸nskede output categorier. Det er ikke viktig at alla kategorier mapper til noe.
