\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter describes details of our implementation for creating a dictionary-based classifier. Several programs were made to achieve this goal, and many of the programs depend on the results from other programs. This chapter covers all the phases of the implementation in the order they were implemented. It starts with section \ref{sec:finding_full_path_of_articles} which describes how we find full path of all Wikipedia articles from the Wikipedia database dump, including how to remove hidden categories from the paths  and how to handle redirects. Further, the chapter describes the id mapping process (section \ref{sec:id_mapping}) and compares this implementation with an implementation where full category names and article titles were used instead of ids. Section \ref{sec:grading_of_categories} covers two ways of deciding relevant categories for each article; grading the  category paths based on inlink and outlink number (subsection \ref{sec:grading_based_on_inlinks_and_outlinks} and grading based on normalized inlink and outlink number (subsection \ref{sec:normalized_grading_based_on_inlinks_and_outlinks}). The mapping between Wikipedia article titles and IAB categories are described with two approaches; mapping based on Wikipedia categories (subsection \ref{sec:mapping_based_on_wikipedia_categories}) and mapping based on Wikipedia path excerpts (subsection \ref{sec:mapping_based_on_wikipedia_path_excerpts}. Finally, section \ref{sec:dictionary_based_classifier_for_other_languages} describes the process of creating a dictionary-based classifier for other languages based on the English classifier and describes how we created a dictionary-based classifier for Norwegian.
