\subsubsection{Problems with the simplified grader}
Since it is desirable with the lowest score as possible, the first problem encountered was that the program favoured short paths. Figure \ref{fig:short_path_favour} gives example of how the shortest path for the article \emph{Alexander Hughes} (English football player  \cite{wiki:alexanderhughes}) is favoured. These paths are not very descriptive of the article, where only the third best path gives information that he is connected to football. Instead, we would like to see if longer paths are better.
