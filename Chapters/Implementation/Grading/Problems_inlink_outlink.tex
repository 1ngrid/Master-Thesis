\subsection{Problems with the simplified grader}
Since it is desirable with the lowest score as possible, the first problem encountered was that the program favoured short paths. 

\begin{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
argentines of serb descent:
* society/ethnicity/ethnicity stubs/ (34.592939)
* culture/ethnicity/ethnicity stubs/ (29.704807)
* humans/ethnic groups/ethnology/ethnicity stubs/ (27.824755)
\end{lstlisting}

This is both correct and wrong at the same time. It is desirable to find short paths, but there should be some punishment if the path is too short?
