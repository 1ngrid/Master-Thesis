\subsection{Grading based on Inlinks and Outlinks} % eller: Grading based on inlink and outlinks 
\subsubsection{Inlinks and Outlinks of Categories}
Each category in Wikipedia has a set of parent categories i.e., categories that lead to the current category, and a set of subcategories i.e., categories that can be reached from the current category. The size of these sets for a given category can be notated as 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Inlink} = number of parent categories
\item \emph{Outlink} = number of subcategories
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig:Categorywparentandsub} is a demonstration of how  \emph{inlink} and \emph{outlink} are connected to a category, and gives the idea that a catgory with high \emph{inlink} and \emph{outlink} are more likely to be visited when looking for paths for an article.

\label{fig:Categorywparentandsub}
\end{figure}


The first assumption is that categories with high \emph{inlink} can be reached from categories that are not about the same.

\end{figure}
%quality: 9, 3
%management: 31, 5
The next assumption is that categories with a high number for \emph{outlink} are more likely to reach categories not relevant since they can reach far in all the subcategories' directions. Figure \ref{fig:politicstosoftware} shows how the Wikipedia article about \emph{Ole-Johan Dahl} can be reached from the category \emph{politics}. One of the categories with a high \emph{outlink} is the category \emph{management}, which has \emph{outlink} as 31 and hence be reached many categories. 

\subsubsection{Grading based on Inlinks and Outlinks}
The assumption that categories with high \emph{inlink} and \emph{outlink} are more often visited leads to the thought that these categories should have a lower score than categories that are more rarly visited. 

The first approach was therefore to find the \emph{inlink} and \emph{outlink} of all categories in the structure. These numbers had to be compared with the average number of \emph{inlink} and \emph{outlink} to know whether the number is high or low (see Table \ref{tab:avginlinkoutlink}). 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\textbf{Average number of \emph{inlink}} & \textbf{Average number of \emph{outlink}}\\ \hline
 5 & 2 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Average number of inlink and outlink}
\label{tab:avginlinkoutlink}
\end{table}

The score for each category was then 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:scoreinout}
Score_{C} = \frac{inlink_{c} + outlink_{c}}{\bar{C_{in}} + \bar{C_{out}}}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{C_{in}}$ is the average \emph{inlink} and $\bar{C_{out}}$ is the average \emph{outlink}.

The scoring from formula \ref{eq:scoreinout} means that paths with categories rarely visited will be favoured, hence given a lower score. 

\subsubsection{Evaluation of the scores}
None of the categories can have a score of 0 since this means they cannot be reached or reach other categories. The lowest score found was 0.376010, which was given to all categories with only one parent and zero subcategories, a total of 104,471 categories.  The category with the highest score is the category \emph{Albums by Artist}, which is the category with most subcategories (17,393), hence a score of $6,512.120784$. Hence the range of the scores is <0.376010, 6,512.120784> where all category scores lie within this range. 

Figure \ref{fig:scorevalue} shows how many categories are found for each of the possible score values. The figure shows that there are many categories with a low score value, while there are only a few categories for the higher score value. The categories with high score value will have a high impact on the article path, hence the path will have a smaller chance of being chosen.

%This means that the score for all categories are between 0.376010 and 6512.120784.
