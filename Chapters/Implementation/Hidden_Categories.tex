Under the structure of Hidden Categories are there 15 385 subcategories, which are not essential.

When looping through \enwikicatlink was 15006 subcategories directly found with links from \emph{Hidden Categories}, which can be marked as not relevant. This reduces number of links relevant between both subcategories and between categories and articles. 

To see the necessity of removing irrelevant categories (the hidden ones), we can look of how number of category and article links are reduced:
