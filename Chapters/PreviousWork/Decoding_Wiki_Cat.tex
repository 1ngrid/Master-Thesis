\section{Decoding Wikipedia Categories for Knowledge Acquistion}

We have seen that the catgories contain lots of information about their pages.

This is relevant when we want to map all our Wikipedia cateogires to the desired categories . 

The paper describes ways of finding out about the content of pages based on the name of the cateogires. We could do similar in our project by using some of the same approaches. The \emph{IN} is a useful way to find all categoires ..
