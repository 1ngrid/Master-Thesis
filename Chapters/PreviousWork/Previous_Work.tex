\chapter{Related Works}
Categorization is not a new topic, nor is taking advantage of Wikipedia in a categorization process. There are many papers about the topic, and we did some research to avoid problems already solved by others and to get inspiration for our project. This chapter is dedicated to projects with related topics. It starts by giving a short introduction to the projects we have studied.
The  projects concerned with Wikipedia's category structure is covered in \ref{sec:category_structure}, while section \ref{sec:extracting_keywords} is dedicated to the process of extracting keywords from Wikipedia. 
%The process of extracting keywords from Wikipedia is covered in section \ref{sec:extracting_keywords}, while section   is dedicated to projects concerned with Wikipedia's category structure. 
Section \ref{sec:classifiers_based_on_wikipedia} covers classifiers based on Wikipedia, including the evaluation of the classifiers studied. Finally, section \ref{sec:disambiguation} gives an introduction to different types of disambiguation in NLP and reviews projects for solving disambiguation.

, before it covers two tasks within the implementation; \emph{extracting keywords} and \emph{deciding content of Wikipedia articles based on the category structure}. Section \ref{sec:disambiguation} is dedicated to different approaches for solving ambiguous words and phrases which is one of the most discussed problems in NLP. Finally, the chapter reviews different approaches of evaluating the classifier and reviews some of the results found in other projects. 

%Some of the projects have also given useful help in the task of deciding on approaches
