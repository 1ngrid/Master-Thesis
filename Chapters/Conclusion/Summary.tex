\section{Summary}
This paper has given a brief introduction to the automatic categorization problem used for content analysis. The main reason for automatic content analysis isthat manual classification is impossible for large collections of text, since it is both time consuming and  depends on experts within the topic of the texts. Automatic content analysis is based on the idea that the computer understands texts by recognizing specific keywords that  connected to one or more predefined categories. The advantages of basing such a keyword list on the titles of articles from Wikipedia is that Wikipedia is a large online encyclopedia that covers lots of subjects and is regularly maintained by lots volunteers. The category set for the classification can vary depending on the purpose of the classification, but it is essential that the predefined set is large enough to cover enough topics, but also so specific that information is preserved. An example of a predefined category set that is well-suited for advertisement is provided by IAB, Interactive Advertising Bureau.
