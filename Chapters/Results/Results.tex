\chapter{Results and Discussion}
This chapters is dedicated to evaluation of the project's results. We start by evaluating the categorization of the keywords where we tried two approaches; mapping between Wikipedia categories and output categories, and mapping between path excerpts and output categories. Further, we evaluate the performance of the dictionary-based classifier, including a section about how to retrieve the classifier's results, the different versions of the classifier, and the results from the classifier. Finally, we evaluate the Norwegian dictionary-based classifier to see how well a translated classifier perform.
