\section{Thesis Outline}
Chapter 2 is dedicated to an introduction of the background needed for understanding the purpose of the project and the methods used in the implementation. The background covers the purpose and definition of content analysis, categorization, IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau), Wikipedia and its structure, and finally the challenges of the project. 

After describing the challenges, the next natural step is to look at previous work and research which is given in chapter 3, along with discussing if these findings can be used in our project. 

Chapter 4 is focusing on the implementation of the project.
