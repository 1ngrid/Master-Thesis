\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this study has been to develop an automatic content categorization which could take any article as input, and determine the most likely category based on its content. Our approach of determining the most likely category is by creating a dictionary-based classifier from Wikipedia, where titles of Wikipedia articles are used as entries, and the entries are connected to one or more suitable categories describing the content of the Wikipedia article. 


%which corresponds to one or more suitable categories. 

% The output categories can e determined by the user to fit different user settings.
