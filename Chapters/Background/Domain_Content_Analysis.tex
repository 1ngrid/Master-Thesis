Automatic content analysis can be found useful in many different settings, but the 
%There are many areas where content analysis (the task of understanding the content of the text) is useful, but the 
two most dominating areas are advertising and improvement of user experience. The focus for this project is to improve advertising and is therefore the main domain.
%Content analysis is useful for understanding texts, and is often used in two domains; advertising and improving user experience. 

Advertising is the main income of most online companies that provide free services. Many online companies provide their services for free, but make their money on advertisement instead. The alternative to this is to charge users a fee, before they are allowed to use the services. The online market is very competitive and most users expect everything on the Internet to be free. The most common approach is therefore to provide the services for free, but earn money on advertising instead. 

%free services with advertisement is to sell access to to their services, 

%but this is in many cases not possible because the online market is very competitive and many users expect everything on the Internet to be free. 

%difficult in many cases because of how competitive the market is and the expectations of a free Internet. 
%Online advertising is a growing market and is the main income of many online companies. 
%Online companies have two ways of earning money, they could either let the user pay to use the services or earn money on advertisement. Most web pages choose the second option because the market is very competitive and many web users expects the web pages to be free. %A newspaper might loose readers when trying to charge them. 

%Hence the companies have to earn money without charging the user for their services, and in most cases  this leads to advertisement. 
There are different approaches of doing advertisement on web pages. The most common ones are PPC (pay per click) and CPM (cost per mille). CPM is an  advertising technique where the advertiser pays for showing the page to a crowd, while PPC means that an advertisement is shown and the advertiser has to pay for each time a user clicks on the advertisement. Both of the techniques are more valuable for all parts if the advertises are shown to people that are interested and more likely to buy their product. The advertiser has a greater chance of getting customers if the advertisement is shown to the right crowd and the publisher can charge a higher price for the advertisement if the advertiser is more pleased with the result of the advertises.

The main advantage of specified advertisement is that the advertisement can be directed towards users that are more likely to become customers. This means that the advertiser needs to know the users and their interests. Content analysis can be part of building up a profile of the user, since knowing the content of user's text can provide information of the interests of the users.
